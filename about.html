					<p>I believe there is always room to learn and improve yourself. This is why growth - physical and mental - is my driving force in life. </p>

					<p>The physical has been there since I was young. I did sports throughout my childhood and teen years, and then found the gym about six years ago. Fitness and health have been my one and only passion for the longest time. I love being able to push myself past my own limitations, and be in control of my own results. </p>

					<p>Recently, I’ve dove deep into the mental side of growth as well. This means focusing more on learning and developing as many skills as possible, as well as being able to better control my mind. One of the skills I got into was coding and web design. </p>

					<p>I immediately loved it, and couldn’t stop. Now that was a huge deal for me, since I wasn’t really passionate about anything except fitness. Throughout my years of school and college, I never knew what I wanted to do as a career. So finding my love for code and building websites was an exciting moment… it was the first time I have had a sense of direction for what I wanted to do. Since then, I have dropped everything and followed that desire. All my time and energy has been devoted to learning and mastering the basics. </p>

					<p>I truly feel like this is what I have been waiting for my whole life. I have found what I want to pursue and I am dedicated to doing whatever it takes to get there. </p>
